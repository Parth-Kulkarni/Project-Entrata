# Project-Entrata
This is a BDD Cucumber framework that enables the testers to write the testcases in the simple and readable format for the technical and non technical persons such as Product Owners, Business Analysts.
I have used POM(Page Object Model) design pattern to seperate the locators and methods from the Step Definitions for the readibility and usability purpose.
