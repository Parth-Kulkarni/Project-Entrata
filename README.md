About the framework - 
This is a BDD Cucumber framework that enables the testers to write the testcases in the simple and readable format for the technical and non technical persons such as Product Owners, Business Analysts.
Through BDD we can pass test data to test a scenario in multiple ways i.e for correct and incorrect ways. 
I have used POM(Page Object Model) design pattern to seperate the locators and methods from the Step Definitions for the readibility and reusability purpose.
We can use the test runner class to run a particular scenario by giving it a tag name and running a particular scenario.
With the cucumber- reports we can see how many testcases were failed, passed and skipped.
